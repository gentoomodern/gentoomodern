- In order to best integrate with the existing Gentoo environment, our scripting language is modern Python.
- Docker-Compose is a key dependency of this workbench and does much heavy lifting.
- An object of type ``munger`` is used to collect the data for each file. It uses the filenames to differentiate between the syntaxes and reads them accordingly. It can then spit out the generated file.
- An object of type ``portage_directory`` is used to hold the munger objects for a portage directory
- An object of type ``portage_directory_combiner`` is used to assemble multiple portage config subdirectories in ``./config``. It uses a file found in in ``./config/stage3.defines`` to find the correct subdirs and munges them in.
- A script called ``pull-upstream-stage`` to bootstrap the local Dockerized image.
- A script called ``pipeline`` runs all the builds in ``./config/build.list`
- A script called ``sync`` starts a root and syncs portage via ``emerge --sync``. Note: Unless you maintain a local rsync mirror for Portage, it is recommended to run this script sparingly and to refrain from using ``emerge --sync`` in your own shells. Otherwise, the upstream servers will block you.
- A script called ``freshroot`` allows the user to start a root from the currently-active stage3 (the one labeled as gentoomodern/stage3:latest
